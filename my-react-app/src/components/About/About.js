          <p>
            I am a Software Developer working In Austin, Texas. I have spent
            2 years in the Technology field. My skillset includes but is not
            limited to React.JS, Node.Js JavaScript and Sequelize. I am also
            Familiar with the Github and Heroku. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In December 2019, I graduated from Texas Tech University then 
            Immedietly enrolled into the UT Austin Tech Boot Camp. My knowledge
            of Fullstack Development has grown since and continues to grow.
            This challenge as well as my education from Texas Tech has 
            rounded me to be a reliable asset to your company. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for growth opportunities in Front-End or
            Full-Stack roles. I would love for you to review my work below.
